//  It took me a while to figure this one out because I'm dumbbbbbbb
//  I was trying to model this with an adjaceny data structure
//  It was a pain, like how to keep track of multiple edges and visited edges, took me hours
//  AHHH I couldn't see that the number of nodes is so small, a simple matrix will do!
//  The rest is just backtracking, don't forget to put back the edges after doing a dfs!
